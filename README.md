# Guess My Number 🔢 ❓

This is another small project where I practiced DOM manipulation. Concept from Jonas Schmedtmann.

## How to play the game?
A random number between 1 and 20 is generated at the beginning of the game. The player has to guess the number guided by the message on the screen.
Each time the user gets the number wrong, the current round score is decremented by 1. The user can reset the game and play as many times as he wants, keeping track of his highscore.

## Features implemented
* dinamically displayed different messages based on the number entered from the user (if the number entered was smaller than the secret number, message "Too low!" is displayed,
if the  number entered was bigger than the secret number, message "Too high!" is displayed, if the number entered is equal to the secret number, message "Correct number!" is displayed)
* dinamically changed the content of HTML elements (if the user gets the number right, the secret number is shown)
* adequately updating the highscore 
* the "Again" button which sets back the initial conditions of the game 
* responsive design
